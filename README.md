Project Stage 1 (1 Point):
    There are a wide range of interesting applications in the domain of computer vision. Good course project topics will have to meet few mandatory criteria:

    Use image or video data as primary data source

    Leverage Computer Vision algorithms on top of data

    Provide value to someone, solve a real problem.

    Deliverables
    A one page proposal submission + resume of each student on Canvas. If you already have team members in mind, you may submit a single proposal as a group. Submissions should inlcude your name(s), grad/undergrad status, phone number and email, a writeup of your topic proposal, a proposed final technology demo, and your resume. Note that, it is ok if one of the team members submits the proposal along with their team members' resumes. If you would like to collaborate with an industry partner (listed on Canvas), include the partner you would like to collaborate with, and tailor your proposal to your partner. Keep in mind that your partner may wish to change your topic. Groups will be selected for partnerships based on the quality of your proposal.

    Example:Project_Proposal.docx  
    Final Team Creation:
    The final decision on the team creation is with the professor and TAs. Ideally, each group will be composed of 3-4 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student. We will do our best to put you with your requested team members, and assign you to the topic of your interest.

project Stage 2 (10 points):
    Students Should submit a document including following things:

    2.1 Research

    Your research should be spread accross a few key areas. Depending on your project, your research may be more "business focused" or more "academically" focused. You should address at least 10 of the questions below, and must choose and review 3 academic papers.

    2.1.1 Business/Customers

    What problem will your Computer Vision solution solve, and for whom?

    What value will it provide them? What are their pain points?

    How big is the potential market?

    Do other similar solutions exist?

    Would your business have any competitors? Who are they? How are they doing?

    How are potential customers dealing with these issues now?

    How much would customer be willing to pay for your product?

    Are your customers individuals or businesses? Be sure to cite the sources you reference in your research.

    2.1.2 Academic Literature Review

    A thorough literature review can save weeks of wasted time implementing dead-end solutions or re-doing work that others have already done. You should pick 3 academic papers (we can help you with this, if needed), and do a "deep-dive" on these publications.

    What academic work is relevant to your project topic? Pick 3 papers, ask us for help if you need it.

    What makes these papers important/relevant?

    What are their results and how did they achieve these results?

    What's different/unique about these approaches?

    2.1.3 Open Source

    What open source code is available that are relevant to your topic?

    How active are the communities around this code?

    What data is available for testing and/or training algorithms?

    Is labeled data available? How much? How is the data licensed? Is it under copyright protection?

    2.1.4 Industry Solutions

    What companies are solving similar problems to yours?

    It can be tough to tell exactly how proprietary solutions work, but what can you find on the internet?

    Has anyone reverse engineered these products?

    If you have access to the product, what can you learn from using it?

    Are there available talks, documentation, or other resources from their engineering teams?

    2.2 Data Collection

    Your project will involve either collecting your own data or using publically available data. Getting your dataset nailed down early is critical to success. For most problems, you will need some type of labels to go with your images or videos. If you're creating your own dataset, you'll likely need to do your own labeling. There are great open source tools to help you with this like labelme.

    Deliverables:

    A writeup addressing 10 of the questions mentioned above, and a jupyter notebook visualizing and summarizing your dataset.

Project stage 3 (15 points): Modeling
    Students should build their models, conduct experiments, look at the literature you reviewed for ideas, and submit a Well-documented, visually pleasing, and clear jupyter notebook presenting results.



Project stage 4 (14 points):
        A video recording of the presentation + demo of your technology. Briefly tell the story of the problem you set out to solve, what you learned about the problem in each of the previous stages, and demo the solution that you have developed. In addition to the presentation, final deliverables include a public Github repo containing a well-documented, visually pleasing, and clear implementation of your solution, final presentation, and deliverables from previous stages. Here are the guidelines for the video recording:

    Every member of the project records a video explaining the part he/she contributed to the project.

    One of the team members stitches all the videos and send it to us.

    The final stitched video should have a proper flow of the entire project.
